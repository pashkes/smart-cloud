                                    <p>Like so many fast growing companies, AccuReg faced the challenge of maintaining
                                        productivity,
                                        accuracy, and visibly across its sales department. They initially had a wide
                                        variety
                                        of
                                        issues including accessing prospects, tracking leads, and monitoring client
                                        relationships.
                                        Despite the use of Salesforce they still struggled to track customer behavior,
                                        execute
                                        follow-ups and connect across multiple platforms.

                                    <p>AccuReg contacted Invisible.io to aid them to resolve visibility and

                                        challenges that prevented the company from reaching its full potential. With

                                        Connect integration, provided by Invisible.io, the sales team was able to
                                        automatically
                                        update, drastically improve communication, and monitor relevant contact history

                                    <p>The sales reps were no longer required to input the data twice, as they could

                                        contacts, add files, create new tasks or log calls into Salesforce without

                                        greater
                                        organization, increased visibility, and better insight into the existing or

                                        customer behavior. </p>
                                    <p>The ability to log all emails, calls and pending tasks from email directly to
                                        Salesforce
                                        saved sales reps a lot of time, increased the accuracy of information, and by
                                        default,
                                        improved follow-up practices. Magic Pixel integration opened the door to a

                                        understanding of customer behavior and monitoring their emails down to the

                                        detail. It
                                        also enabled the department to improve their sales marketing strategy and client
                                        approach.</p>

                            <p>The roots of Belden Brick Company can be traced back all the way to 1885 in Ohio. In
                                its many years of operation, the company continually grew and expanded. Currently,
                                The Belden Brick Company is the sixth largest brick manufacturer in the United
                                States, and the number one largest manufacturer that’s still family owned. Belden
                                Brick operates six plants in Tuscarawas County and employs approximately 500
                                people.</p>

                                                                 alt="The Challenge"></div>

                                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                                    <p>Belden Brick Company’s success depends not only on the quality of products,
                                        but also the efficiency of its sales representatives. While the company was
                                        armed with a sizeable sales team, composed of approximately hundred members,
                                        the reps struggled to adapt and connect with Salesforce actively. The hassle
                                        of having to manually enter information into the CRM system caused
                                        significant delays in the sales cycle due to time-sensitivity.
                                        The main issues included inaccurate customer data, low overall visibility,
                                        and human error, all of which made it nearly impossible to get up-to-date
                                        information when out of the office.

                                    <h3>Solutions</h3>
                                    <p>Belden Brick approached Invisible.io to help solve the synchronization and
                                        sales cycle management challenges they were facing. The integration of the
                                        SmartCloud Connect tool, offered by Invisible.io, into the sales team’s
                                        workflow enabled automatic synchronization of email, tasks, and calendar
                                        with Salesforce across all devices without the need for additional plugins
                                        and tools.
                                        SmartCloud Connect provided a bi-directional synchronization of Outlook and
                                        Salesforce contacts. It also scheduled calendar events and activities
                                        including meetings, appointments, phone calls and task updates. Sales
                                        representatives were able to customize which types of calendar events, or
                                        emails got synced with Salesforce, and the seamless integration of Chatter
                                        encouraged internal communication and collaboration. The sales team gained a
                                        holistic view of all meetings and tasks at hand not matter from where they
                                        logged in.</p>
                                    <p>The sales reps were no longer required to input the data twice, as they could
                                        keep
                                        their
                                        inbox and Salesforce data synchronized. They gained the instrumental ability
                                        to
                                        create
                                        contacts, add files, create new tasks or log calls into Salesforce without
                                        leaving
                                        their
                                        email. Furthermore, Magic Pixel implementation (a code embedded into user’s
                                        email
                                        the

                                    <p>After installing SmartCloud Connect, AccuReg’s sales department profited from
                                        greater
                                        organization, increased visibility, and better insight into the existing or
                                        prospective
                                        customer behavior. </p>
                                    <p>From a single SmartCloud Connect installation, Belden Brick Company sales
                                        team experienced greater organization as well as a faster and more
                                        productive sales process.
                                        The newly acquired ability to access necessary information directly from
                                        their mailbox and calendar enabled the reps to act, react and follow up
                                        faster and more appropriately, which directly benefited their quality of
                                        business relationships. In terms of time savings and productivity, accessing
                                        all client information within the context of previous conversations and
                                        notes eliminated valuable time wasted on endless data searches.
                                        Additionally, creating new CRM records instantaneously and automatically
                                        from email allowed the sales team to devote their time to more important
                                        tasks.</p>

                                    <p>Bi-directional synchronization and ease of access prevented possibly harmful
                                        data loss and significantly increased active use of Salesforce, making the
